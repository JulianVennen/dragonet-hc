Dragonet is a FOSS support center that you can host yourself, or license from us at a price.

We are currently still in progress, and unavailable to customers.

**We currently plan to support:**
- Article creation
- Support ticket creation
- Integrations with social media such as:
  - Discord
  - Twitter
  - Reddit
  - Telegram
- API for custom apps
- Webhook deliveries for events such as:
  - support tickets being opened
  - support tickets being closed
  - support tickets receiving replies
  - new article being created
  - article being added
  - article being edited
  - article being removed

Of course, when we finish the basic functions such as articles and plain support tickets, we will release and gradually add more features as we go.
We will always look into improving it for the user and customer experience. If you are experiencing issues, or you want to contribute:
